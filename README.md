# password-generator

My task was to create a password generator that gives the user a series of prompts the user then the user selects criteria to include within the password.
The prompts give the user the option of length between 8-128 characters, then the user is asked whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
When all promts are answered then a password is genereated with the corrects criteria.

## What was done
* added variables to hold user choices, hold results in empty array, hold possible characters in empty array, and hold confirmed characters in an empty array.
* added several if statements to checked whether you chose each type of character
* used math.random to get random array index
